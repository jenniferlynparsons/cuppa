# cuppa

> A full MERN stack tea collection tracker

Cuppa is built on React with Redux, Node using Express and Mongoose, and connected to a MongoDB database. It also uses JWT tokens for authentication and user management. Scripts are built using Parcel instead of Webpack. This is not a Create-React-App-based project.

## Background
Cuppa was created to fill a personal need. I have a large variety of teas I enjoy drinking, a whole cabinet full of them. In order to keep track of what I drink, how much, when I'm running low, etc. I needed a simple app. Coincedentally, I wanted to dig deeper into React and build something full stack while I was at it. The end result is Cuppa.

## Install

After downloading the repo, run `npm install` in both the root and client folders.

You'll need to create a MongoDB database (I used [mlab.com](mlab.com)). Once that's complete, make a copy of the `.env.default` file in the root, rename it `.env` and paste in the correct uri for your database.

## Local Usage

- Use `npm run dev` to launch both the server and front end apps.
- On a successful build, you can then open `http://localhost:1234` to view the app.

## Heroku Usage

- Use `npm run build` to create a static build.
- Add `MONGOURI` and the url for the mongoDB database to the Config Vars on Heroku's dashboard.
- [Deploy to Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git)
