            This project is under development and not meant for folks to use
            yet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently the teas added are not tied to a particular user and all
            the data may be wiped at any time.
          </p>
          <p>
            You're free to register an account, but that might get wiped, too.
          </p>
          <p>
            Basically, everything is volatile on this site and you shouldn't
            depend on it to actually store your teas yet.
